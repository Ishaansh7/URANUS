AI driven Smart News Suggestion Engine based upon User Interests
This project aims to provide personalized news recommendations based on user queries. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system offers relevant news articles tailored to individual interests.

Overview
In today's digital age, the abundance of information can be overwhelming. Users often struggle to find relevant news articles amidst the vast array of available content. This news recommendation system addresses this challenge by analyzing user queries and suggesting articles that match their preferences.

Features
Text Preprocessing: The system preprocesses news articles by lowercasing, removing non-alphanumeric characters, and combining headline and abstract text for better analysis.
Feature Extraction: Utilizing techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and hashing, the system extracts features from the text data to represent articles in a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Similarity Search: With the help of FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), the system constructs an index of article features to efficiently perform similarity searches. This allows for fast retrieval of articles similar to a given query.
Personalized Recommendations: By analyzing user queries and their browsing history, the system offers personalized news recommendations. It takes into account factors like user preferences, sentiment analysis, and relevance to ensure a tailored experience.
